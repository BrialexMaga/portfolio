        <p class="man-content">
            Small web app using Express.js that simulated a robot control pannel,
            which needed to set up some automation processes, including triggers, pipelines, and deployment scripts, to implement CI/CD on the server.
            <span class="description-br">The scripts were written in Python and Bash, and the server was deployed on Microsoft Azure.</span>

        <h2 class="man-title">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p class="man-content">
            This project was part of a DevOps course. I was assigned to a small team, and our final project was a robot control panel implemented as a webpage, 
            where we applied the DevOps knowledge we had learned.

            <span class="description-section">
                My tasks included setting up all the triggers, pipelines, the server, and several scripts.
            </span>

            <span class="description-section">
                The scripts, written in Python and Bash, were used to generate random data on the webpage to display in the control panel. 
                The triggers and pipelines were configured using GitHub Actions, since the project was already hosted on GitHub. I wrote YAML code to set them up. 
                <span class="description-br">
                    The server was deployed on Microsoft Azure, mainly because I had access to a free trial as a university student.
                </span>
            </span>
            
            <span class="description-section">
                I presented our project, and we received positive feedback from the mentors. After the course, I even received a job offer, but unfortunately, 
                I had to decline due to scheduling conflicts with my university studies.
